    "## Purpose of this project: \n",
    "To compare happiness levels per State with Drug Overdose levels as well as instance of mental illness per state. Additionally, I will look at which states have the most readily available Naloxone. \n",
    "Naloxone is a medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) designed to rapidly reverse opioid overdose. It is an opioid antagonist—meaning that it binds to opioid receptors and can reverse and block the effects of other opioids, such as heroin, morphine, and oxycodone.\n",
    "According to my research: 8 states currently allow individuals to get naloxone from a pharamcy without a prescription. I want to compare which states have high levels of overdose with those with less restriction on obtaining Naloxone. "

    "- 1. having readily accessible naloxone allows for drug users to push boundaries with their use as they can more easily prepare others to help them in case of an accidental overdose\n",

Because only 8 states actually have this allowance, it is likely there isn't enough data to say that this average is actually helpful in determining the effects of expanding naloxone access. Additionally, two of the states who rank in the top 10 for overdose deaths are on the list for naloxone allowance without a prescription, so it is possible these states chose to implement this to battle the effects of opioid misuse, but that it has not yet been enough time. \n",
    "- note: in my opinion, even in states where you can get it without a prescription, it is not always widely promoted or talked about in a way that allows for more individuals to learn about how and when to use naloxone for themselves, their loved ones, or eben stangers. \n",
